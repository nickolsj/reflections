What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo, it creates the neccessary git files
to enable file tracking and commits. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate step between the wd and the repo. It allows the user
to be sure of the contents of the commit before submitting it.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are useful when you want to try a different version of a program, such as an easy mode or in a different language.
Branches keep them separated so the different idea can be fully tested without muddling up the master branch, or main version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show the parents of each commit clearly, and makes it clear which commits are unreachable.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

One branch is merged into the other. Lines intentionally deleted are removed, and features added in both branches
will show up in the merged version. It is represented the way it is because the new version is a commit, it
just has two parent commits.
