What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo, it creates the neccessary git files
to enable file tracking and commits. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate step between the wd and the repo. It allows the user
to be sure of the contents of the commit before submitting it.
