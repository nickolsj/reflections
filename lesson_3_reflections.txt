When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to have your work on a remote repository if you plan on working with multiple
machines or if other people are contributing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone contributing to a remote could mess up what you are working on if you automatically sync to it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: When you want to modify someones repository for your own needs
but they want to preserve theirs.

Clones: Used to update local repositories.

Branches: Used to test out different directions of your own repository.
